					<p>“According to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">M.</abbr> Leibniz what is active in every substance ought to be reduced to a true unity. Since therefore the body of every man is composed of several substances, each of them ought to have a principle of action really distinct from the principle of each of the others. He will have the action of every principle to be spontaneous. Now this must vary the effects <i>ad infinitum</i>, and confound them. For the impression of the neighbouring bodies must needs put some constraint upon the natural spontaneity of every one of them.” <a href="editors-introduction.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
